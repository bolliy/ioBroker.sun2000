**Tests:** ![Test and Release](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

**This adapter uses Sentry libraries to automatically report exceptions and code errors to the developers.**\
For more details and for information how to disable the error reporting see [Sentry-Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/ioBroker/plugin-sentry#plugin-sentry)!\
Sentry reporting is used starting with js-controller 3.0.

## sun2000 adapter for ioBroker

Read and write register data from Huawei SUN2000 inverter and LUNA2000 battery using Modbus TCP. Third-party devices can be integrated via the modbus proxy. Even a Huawei SmartLogger can be integrated.

[Huawei product information](https://solar.huawei.com/en/professionals/all-products?residential-smart-pv)

Feel free to follow the discussions in the german [iobroker forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/71768/test-adapter-sun2000-v0-1-x-huawei-wechselrichter)

## Dependencies
* Node.js 18.18.0 or higher
* ioBroker host (js-controller) 5.0.19 or higher
* ioBroker admin 5.1.13 or higher

## Documentation

See the [documentation page](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/blob/main/docs/README.md) or 
browse in the [wiki](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/wiki)

## Supported hardware

* HUAWEI Inverter SUN2000 Serie (M0,M1,M2 and higher) 
* HUAWEI Smart Dongle-WLAN-FE / min. Softwareversion: V100R001C00SPC133 (SDongleA-05)
* HUAWEI Luna2000 Battery
* HUAWEI Smart Power Sensor DTSU666-H or DDSU666-H
* HUAWEI Smart Logger / min. Softwareversion: V300R023C10SPC311
* HUAWEI EMMA / min. Softwareversion: V100R024C00SPC101

## Feature list

* Maximum `5 inverters` (master/slave) can be processed, each with a battery module (max. 15kWh).
* `Real-time` values such as input power, output power, charging/discharging power and the grid consumption are read out at a fixed interval. 
* States are only written for changed data from the inverter. This relieves the burden on the iobroker instance.
* The states “inputPower” or “activePower” in the “collected” path can be monitored with a “was updated” trigger element. Because these states are always written within the set interval.
* [`Battery charge control`](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/wiki/Battery-control): The battery charging mode of Huawei LUNA2000 batteries can be controlled. Here you can activate and deactivate the battery charging mode to "charging from grid”. In addition, the charging capacity and charging power can be adjusted.
* [`Force charge discharge battery`](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/wiki/Erzwungenes-Laden-und-Entladen-der-Batterie-(Force-charge-discharge-battery)): Forced charge/discharge is usually used to test the battery connected to an inverter. Normally it is not recommended to perform forced charging/discharging. 
* [`Export Control`](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/wiki/Begrenzung-Netzeinspeisung-(Export-Control)): The excess PV energy is fed into the power grid, but not all countries allow users to sell electricity. Some countries have introduced regulations to restrict the sale of electricity to the grid. 
* [`modbus-proxy`](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/wiki/Modbus-Proxy): Third party device such as wallbox, energy manager etc. can receive data even if the modbus interface of inverter is already in use. In addition you can mirror the sun2000 data to another IoBroker instance.
* Huawei [`SmartLogger`](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/wiki/SmartLogger) integration: Monitors and manages the PV power system. The adapter saves the collected data in the same way as it does when read out the inverter directly.
* Huawei [`Emma`]() integration: The Modbus access, network connectivity (WiFi and Ethernet) and the DDSU/DTSU-666H smart meter functions are integrated in one unit - the use of the Sdongle becomes redundant. In addition Huawei EV chargers and load shedding/control (via selected Shelly devices) are supported and "intelligent" controlled.
