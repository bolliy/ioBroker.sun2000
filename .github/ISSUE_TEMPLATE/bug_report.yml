        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in this adapter!**

        If this is the first time you are doing this, please take a few moments to read
        through the [README](https://github.com/bolliy/ioBroker.sun2000/blob/main/README.md).

        You are about to report a bug in **sun2000 Adapter**. Do not proceed if your issues
        occurs with ioBroker, any third party adapters, unofficial or outdated
        adapter versions.

        Do also not seek support here ("I need help with ...", "I have a
        question ...", "Can someone walk me through ..."), that belongs into the
        [discussions in the german iobroker forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/71768/test-adapter-sun2000-v0-1-x-huawei-wechselrichter).

        And finally, make sure any bug you want to report is still present with the **current**
        adapter (beta) version.

        Thank you for your collaboration!
